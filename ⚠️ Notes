⚠️ Notes

 -> Internet Connection: Required for online speech recognition and for downloading NLP models on first run.

-> Offline Mode: Vosk enables speech recognition without internet, but the Vosk language model must be downloaded manually and placed in the project directory.

-> PyAudio Issues: PyAudio may fail to install via pip on some systems. Install PortAudio first or use a precompiled wheel (recommended on Windows).

-> Model Downloads: BART and MarianMT models are automatically downloaded by Hugging Face during the first execution and may take time.

-> Hardware: CPU is sufficient, but using a system with more RAM improves performance for large transformer models.

-> Microphone Access: Ensure microphone permissions are enabled for proper speech input.
